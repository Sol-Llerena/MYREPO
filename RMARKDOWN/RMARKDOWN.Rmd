# install packeges

install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
#package knittr to generate an markdown formatted document. If knitter is installed we should see the option to knit a document together

#insert a code chunk to include R code into your Rmarkdown document. To do this, select the insert code chunk button 
## R Markdown

#Control the output of your chunks using different parameters:


##{r chunk_name, ...}

#Global parameters
#```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#```


#We can set chunks to show up in the resulting document by setting some options like include=TRUE


#now we shoul have all of this 
#library(knitr)
#library(ggplot2)
#library(markdown)

3 with this we can include codes ansd plot like the ones we didi before
#data("mtcars")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(color = wt)) +
  xlab("Weight") + 
  ylab("Miles per gallon") +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "forestgreen", high = "black")
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

3 how to set different header levels:

## First-level header

## Second-level header

### Third-level header

####Style and emphasis####
#`*italic*` 
italic

#`_italic_` 

`**bold**` 

`__bold__`

#Blockquotes are written after >, e.g.,


# UNORDERED LISTS
#Unordered list items start with *, -, or +, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list, e.g.,, output wil be a list by hyphens or bubbbles 

#Ordered list items start with numbers (you can also nest lists within lists), e.g.,
a word
1. the first item
2. the second item
3. the third item
    - one unordered item
    - one unordered item


### LINKS ###
# we can Use plain address either as an actual link, within the text or linked to

####IMAGES###
provide a file path to the image from the current rmd file. For ease just put the file in the same directory as your rmd file.

# IMPORTANT #If you forgot the exclamation mark (!),IT WILL BE A LINK 


###TABLES##

#MARKDONW AS FOLLOWS 

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell


# To make this easier we could use  knitr with kable:

kable(head(mtcars, n = 5), digits = 3, format = "markdown")

#When we click the Knit, it will render the document using the existing syntax.

  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
